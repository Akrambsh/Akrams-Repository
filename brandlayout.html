           <h1><ins> THE EARLY DAYS </ins></h1>
        <p id="para"> Starbucks was founded by Jerry Baldwin, Gordon Bowker, and Zev Siegl, opening its first store in 1971 near the historic Pike Place Market in Seattle. The three Starbucks founders had two things in common: they were all coming from academia, and they all loved coffee and tea. They invested and borrowed some money to open the first store in Seattle and named it “Starbucks” after the first mate, Starbuck, in Herman Melville’s classic novel Moby Dick.Alfred Peet, a coffee-roasting entrepreneur, was a major inspiration to the founders of Starbucks. Peet was a Dutch immigrant who had begun importing fine arabica coffees into the United States during the 1950s. In 1966 he opened a small store, Peet’s Coffee and Tea, in Berkeley, California, that specialized in importing first-rate coffees and teas. Peet’s success encouraged the Starbucks founders to base their business model on selling high-quality coffee beans and equipment, and Peet’s became the initial supplier of green coffee beans to Starbucks. The partners then purchased a used roaster from Holland, and Baldwin and Bowker experimented with Alfred Peet’s roasting techniques to create their own blends and flavours. <br>Schultz announced in 2000 that he was stepping down as CEO but would remain as chairman. By 2007 the chain boasted more than 15,000 locations worldwide but was foundering, and in January 2008 Schultz returned as CEO. He oversaw the closure of 900 stores and implemented an ambitious strategy to secure new avenues of growth, which included acquisitions of a bakery chain and the makers of a coffee-brewing system as well as the introduction of an instant-coffee brand. He also oversaw changes to menu offerings at Starbucks stores; Starbucks had begun selling food in its cafés in 2003. These moves were largely successful, and by 2012 Starbucks had rebounded financially. Schultz again stepped down as CEO and was replaced as CEO by Kevin Johnson in 2017. Schultz continued to be active in the company, serving as executive chairman until 2018, when he was replaced by Myron Ullman. The world’s largest Starbucks, a Starbucks Reserve Roastery, opened in Chicago in 2019. In 2021 Starbucks had a presence in dozens of countries around the globe and operated over 32,000 stores.
During this time, however, Starbucks was also facing various challenges. Notably, workers at several of its stores began to unionize, despite opposition from the company. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and related supply-chain issues had a negative impact on sales, especially in China, one of the company’s key markets. In 2022 Johnson abruptly departed, and Schultz returned as interim CEO. Later that year Starbucks announced that it had hired Laxman Narasimhan to replace Schultz in 2023. </p>
